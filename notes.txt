* Had to configure my network like Serenity's network
    - Set cluster endpoint and node traffic to private
    - Updated cluster security group to allow SSH traffic
        from inside Blue network (10.0.0.0/8)

* AWS EKS had some interesting behavior where my AWS IAM user had
    to be explicitly given access to the cluster from within the
    cluster settings, despite my IAM user having Admin access

* Updating minikube's registry mirror
    - https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube/issues/6848#issuecomment-660601519
    - This is needed for pulling images within my corp network

* Updating minikube's trusted certs
    - https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/handbook/untrusted_certs/
